# QGIS-Hangs-on-Ready
QGIS does not open, hangs on Ready!


QGIS would not open, hangs on Ready. When I powered off my printer, QGIS would open properly.

My printer has two memory card slots - Y: and Z: drives on my system. They are empty, no card inserted. With the printer powered off, in the QGIS browser, I right clicked on each and selected "Hide from Browser". Problem solved.

QGIS now opens with the printer powered on.
